 * The Gmail mark, inlined rather than hotlinked — the modals that use it have
 * to render even when the network is the thing that's broken.
 *
 * Shared by both email-code steps (admin creation and sign-in) so the two
 * prompts show the same picture; it is pure presentation, with none of the
 * wording those two modals deliberately keep separate.
